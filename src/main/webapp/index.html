  <h2>Welcome to the <i>Lift</i> Web Framework</h2>
  <p><i>Lift</i> is yet another web development framework.
    <i>Lift</i> runs inside a Java web container and
    uses the <a href='http://scala-lang.org'>Scala</a> programming language for coding.
    <i>Lift</i> stresses security, developer productivity, ease of deployment, ease of maintainability, performance, and compatibility with existing systems.</p>
  <p><i>Lift</i> borrows from the best of existing frameworks including 
    
    <a href='http://seaside.st/'>Seaside's</a> highly granular sessions and security,
    <a href='http://www.rubyonrails.com/'>Rails</a> fast flash-to-bang, 
    <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django's</a> "more than just CRUD is included",
    and <a href='http://erlyweb.org/'>Erlyweb's</a> scalability for Comet-style applications.</p>
  
  <p><i>Lift</i> is built on <a href='http://scala-lang.org'>Scala</a>, a hybrid Functional and 
    O-O language that compiles code down to the Java Virtual Machine.
    Scala code can call any Java code and make use of all Java classes.
    Java code can call some Scala code. <i>Lift</i> applications are packaged as WAR files and 
    can be deployed on any
    Servlet 2.4 engine (e.g., Tomcat 5.5.xx, Jetty 6.0, etc.)</p>
  
  <p><i>Lift</i> code is as clean and brief as Rails, yet performs 6 times faster and
    is multithreaded.  Additionally, because Scala is strongly typed, the compiler
    catches type errors.  For example:<br/>
    <code>
      <pre>
	User.find(By(User.email, "foo@bar.com")) // legal
	User.find(By(User.birthday, new Date("Jan 4, 1975"))) // legal
	User.find(By(User.birthday, "foo@bar.com")) // compiler error
      </pre>
    </code>
    And <i>Lift</i> has lots of helper methods to make things clean and
    simple:<br />
    <code>
      <pre>
	User.find(20) // find the user with primary key 20
	// find all the users that registered 4 days ago
	User.findAll(By(User.registered, 4.days.ago)) 
	// activate the account or suspend it after 4 days
	State(NewAcct, On({case Activate =>}, Activated),After(4 days, Suspended))
	State(Suspended) entry {sendSuspendedEmail}
      </pre>
    </code>
    But the LoC and total character count for <i>Lift</i> and Rails substantive code is similar,
    however, the LoC for <i>Lift</i> tests is about 60% compared to Rails because there's no need
    to write tests for type-related issues.
